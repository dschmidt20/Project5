Welcome to Put Me In, Coach!

Here you can create your own MLB lineup using any combination of players from all eras.
You can compare the stats of your lineup to the "best" lineup of all time.
You can simulate at-bats between any hitter and any pitcher in history and, using their career stats, see what results that hypothetical matchup would yield.
Lastly, you can view the what lineups the other users on the app have created and see how your creations stack up.

This app was created in React.js with a Ruby on Rails backend, and used a mix of React Bootstrap and CSS for styling.
